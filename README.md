The Project Story
## Inspiration
Have you ever felt that your meetings are going into circles? That you are having a hard time streamlining your inputs, decisions and follow up actions? Well, now Minutely AI is here to assist you and get your meetings to the next level! This amazing team productivity app will help you get all your meeting minutes recorded, transcribed and forwarded automatically to all the meeting participants with a list of action items on-the-go

## What it does
We have designed the app to be simple, intuitive and yet powerful with a complete user-centric approach, everything works with a simple button push, your meeting can be either transcribed in real-time, or you can upload a meeting recording, then our backend takes over to provide sentiment analysis, identify action items and forward the MoMs to the meeting participants
 
## How we built it
Building it was thanks to the work of 3 Data Scientists, a Front-end developer, a Back-end developer and a UX/UI designer. We all come from the corporate world where we are having countless meetings everyday and a solution to streamline and automate all the inefficiencies in today's corporate world became a necessity. It all started by a design brainstorming session where we imagined all possible features that we could think of and then prioritized the most important ones. After that, we split the workshare among the team members according to the skills. We started first coding the speech2text technobrick using the DeepSpeech model and benchmarking it with other models on the market

Before we started building the frontend of the project, we needed to do 2 things. Write down a well-defined project scope, with 1-3 of the most important features, in order to get our MVP vision. The other was to create an ideal user workflow story, so it was clear to us how the user would use our web application for their needs. Next we came up with some mock drawings and created some more detailed ones in Figma. Once the design was completed, we started building the frontend using React, and styling it with TailWindCSS. This involved creating the application UI dashboard, building the file upload system to handle sending of large files to our backend and populating the dashboard sections with the AI generated information.

## Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we have faced, especially as we were a Hybrid team with 2 people present physically on-site and the rest participating remotely, and this is more of a logistics challenge that can also tell us about how challenging it is to make hybrid workplaces,
On the technical side, we ran into a major challenge in matters of available Speech2Text technologies that are good enough for the quality standards we have set ourselves. Basically, all speech2Text Packages/APIs that are available are proprietary, which means they are not for free
